# ohwyy_proj_template_cc

Template for starting Oceanhackweek project repos. Add country code (cc) in the end to indicate the location of your event (us/au).

This repo is an example of how teams can structure their project repositories and format their project README.md file, but feel free to adapt as suits your needs.

**Folders**

* `Contributor folders` Each contributor should make a folder here and push their work here during the week. This will allow everyone to see each others work but prevent any merge conflicts.
* `Final notebooks` When the team develops shared final notebooks, they can be shared here. Make sure to communicate so that you limit merge conflicts.
* `scripts` Shared scripts or functions can be added here.
* `data` Share dataset can be shared here. Note, do not put large datasets on GitHub. Speak to the organizers if you need to share large datasets.
